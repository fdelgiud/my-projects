# 🏊 Tableau Project – Olympics Swimming Analysis

## Overview

This project explores over a century of Olympic competitive pool swimming results, from **1912 to 2020**, using interactive data visualization tools in **Tableau**. The aim is to uncover patterns in athlete performance, medal trends, and race characteristics across different Olympic Games editions.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes results from Olympic swimming competitions and is sourced from the official Olympics website ([olympics.com](https://olympics.com)). Each row corresponds to either an individual swimmer or a relay team. The variables include:

- **Location** — Host city of the Games  
- **Year** — Edition of the Olympic Games  
- **Distance** — Race length (in meters)  
- **Stroke** — Type of swimming stroke (e.g., freestyle, butterfly, breaststroke, backstroke, medley)  
- **Relay** — Indicates if the race is an individual or relay event  
- **Gender** — Male or female categories  
- **Team** — Country or national team  
- **Athlete** — Name of the swimmer  
- **Results** — Time taken to complete the race  
- **Rank** — Final standing (gold, silver, bronze, no medal, disqualified, did not finish, no data)


## Goals

- Analyze medal distribution and rank trends by gender, nation, and stroke type  
- Identify standout athletes and dominant countries over the decades  
- Explore race times and distance trends across Olympic years  
- Visualize how relay and individual events differ in outcomes


## Tools & Technologies

- **Tableau Public** — For interactive dashboards and visual analysis  
- **Python (for preprocessing, optional)** — Libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` can be used for data cleaning and transformation (not required but recommended)
