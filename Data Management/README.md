# 🎶 BEYOND THE STAGE

## Navigating Music Awards & Spotify Insights (2013–2023)



## 🎯 Overview

**BEYOND THE STAGE** investigates the intersection of industry recognition and public popularity by analyzing winners of three major U.S. music awards:

* 🎵 **Billboard Music Awards (BMAs)** – focused on commercial performance.
* 🏆 **Grammy Awards** – centered on artistic merit.
* 🗳 **American Music Awards (AMAs)** – reflecting public opinion via online voting.

The study spans from **2013 to 2023**, excluding non-music-related categories. To enrich the analysis, **Spotify** listening trends were integrated to reflect public sentiment and engagement.


## Project Objective

This project was developed as part of a **Data Management** exam. The goal was to:

* 🔍 **Collect** data through **web scraping** (award archives and Spotify)
* 🗄️ **Structure** and store the data in a **relational SQL database**
* 📊 **Analyze** and visualize trends using **Python**


##  Key Insights

* **Partial overlap** exists between award winners and Spotify’s most-streamed artists.
* **Grammy Awards** tend to diverge from streaming trends, prioritizing artistic recognition.
* **Billboard Music Awards** closely align with Spotify metrics due to their commercial focus.
* **American Music Awards**, driven by fan votes, reflect public taste more directly.
* **Spotify data** reveals shifts in genre popularity and artist breakthrough moments.



##  Data Sources

* Official award websites (BMAs, Grammys, AMAs) — **scraped using Python**
* Spotify artist and track data — **scraped from publicly available web content**



## Technologies Used

* **Python** for scraping, data cleaning, and analysis
* Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `BeautifulSoup`, `requests`
* **PostgreSQL / SQLite** for database organization
* **SQL** for querying structured music award and Spotify data


## Methodology

1. **Web Scraping**: Collected structured data from award and Spotify-related pages
2. **Database Design**: Organized cleaned data into normalized SQL tables
3. **Analysis**: Explored consistency across awards, recurring winners, and Spotify trends
4. **Visualization**: Created visual comparisons between awards and public popularity
